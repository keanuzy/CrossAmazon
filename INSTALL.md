# INSTALL Docuement

In order to set up and run the project you will need to have React, Express.js, and Node.hs installed. At the same time, some Dependencies need to be installed，for example: nodemon, cors, dotenv, bootstrap, axios, mongoose, concurrently, react-router-dom.

## Installing Node.js

You can install Node.js directly on your machine by visiting [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to find a pre-built installer for your platform.

## Installing React

After you download and install Node, start your terminal/command prompt and run
 `$ node -v` and `npm -v` to see which versions you have.

If your version of npm earlier than 5.2.0 then you have to run this command to update it:
`$ npm install -g npm`

Else, you can install your app, after go to your workspace(folder) and run the following command:
`$ npx create-react-app my-app`
The installation process may take a few minutes. After it is done, you should see a folder that appears in your workspace with the name you gave to your app.

## MongoDB Atlas

We use the MongoDB Atlas which is a cloud-hosted server on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud to operate database.

## Express.js

Assuming you’ve already installed Node.js, create a directory to hold your application, and make that your terminal in your working directory.

1. Run `$ npm init` in the terminal
2. Run `$ npm install express --save` "save" for save it in the dependencies list.
